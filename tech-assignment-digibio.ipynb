    "  - In the nucleus, chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation. The condensation starts peripherally along the nuclear membrane, forming a crescent or ringlike structure. During later stages of apoptosis, the nucleus further condenses, and finally, it breaks up inside a cell with an intact cell membrane, a feature described as karyorrhexis.\n",

In contrast to apoptosis, necrosis is a passive form of cell death without the intricate regulatory mechanisms that are characteristic of apoptosis. The causes of necrotic cell death such as heat stress or toxic agents can in many cases also induce apoptotic cell death.<br>\n",
    "  The morphology of cells dying by necrosis is fairly diverse. The cell membrane becomes permeable early during the death process. Organelles may dilate, and ribosomes may dissociate from the endoplasmic reticulum. The nucleus disintegrates late, and in some cases, chromatin condensation occurs. However, pyknotic and fragmented nuclei are not common features in necrotic cell death. Small charged molecules that normally do not traverse the cell membrane will then enter the cell.\n",

    "- **Cell morphology**: Living cells tend to have a regular and uniform morphology, while dead cells can have irregular shapes and sizes due to cell shrinkage or swelling.\n",

    "- **Nucleus morphology**: The nucleus of a living cell is usually round and uniform in shape, while the nucleus of a dead cell can be fragmented or have irregular shapes due to the breakdown of chromatin.\n",

    "- **Cytoplasmic granularity**: Living cells often have a uniform and homogenous cytoplasmic texture, while dead cells can have granular or clumped cytoplasmic regions due to cell death processes such as necrosis or apoptosis.\n",
